	Usage: syncdir SRC <target>

	syncdir is only a small tool that used to sync
	a file from restricted path to unrestricted path. 

	This is good for a code that stored in vFat partition
	that does not has a support for storing executeable
	file or binaries, Especially for those ones who stuck
	compiling binaries.

	SRC    - Original source directory from restricted path
	target - Target path for the good/unrestricted side.

	If there's no <target> provided, The current directory will
	used to get synced directory. You may need to re-sync it if
	there's a new file from original source.

	Do not use the synced directory for git. That would lead you
	to a very big issue. Copy every files from original source
	if you're done.

	Example of usage:
	  syncdir /media/$(whoami)/usb/my-project
