patch_hardlinks, Yes you know what is this.
A simple shell program written in dash just for fixing all of hardcoded path, So you can compile a package in termux perfectly.

 ~/cli-visualizer $ patch_hardlinks .

Yes, put the dot at the end.


Wait in a fucking second, Read this
===================================
